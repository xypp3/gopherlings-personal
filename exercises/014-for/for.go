// Problem:

//  for i := 0; i <= 10; i = i + 1 {

//  i := 0

	// how to write for loops long after they've seen the
	// syntax for the first time. Keep in mind when fixing
	// this for statement that
	//  1. The first statement is the init (runs once at start)
	//  2. Second is the condition. For loop executes while condition yields true
	//  3. Third is the post statement. This runs at the end of each loop.
